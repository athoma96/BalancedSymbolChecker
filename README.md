# BalancedSymbolChecker
A C program that will determine whether input is given with properly balanced
symbols. We will often use symbols together to specify the beginning and ending of an item, such as
the use of parentheses in a mathematic expression or the use of curly braces in a C, C++ or Java
program. For this program, we will be checking the following symbol pairs:
• parentheses: ( )
• curly braces: { }
• square brackets: [ ]
• angle brackets: < >
This program will require the use of a stack implemented in a dynamic array. This dynamic array is
to grow to a larger size when a push operation would be done to a full array causing an array
overflow.
